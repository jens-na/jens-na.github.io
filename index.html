Hey, my name is Jens. I am a computer science student
from Wiesbaden, Germany. 
</p>
<p>
Before I started studying I have worked as a software developer. I wrote plugins for 
the IDE Eclipse and maintained Java web applications, better known as J2EE or JEE applications.</p>

At the moment I am interested in hardware development and work a lot
with <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> implementations.
