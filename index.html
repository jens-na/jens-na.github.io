Hey, my name is Jens. I am a computer science student
from Wiesbaden, Germany. 
</p>
<p>
Before I started studying I have worked as a software developer. I wrote plugins for 
the IDE Eclipse and maintained Java web applications, better known as J2EE or JEE applications.</p>
<p>
I believe in the concept of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
  software</a>.</p>
